		<p>When the weather is warm we also sometimes hold a beginner friendly Jam Session for jazz musicians around 3:30 - 4:30pm. Feel free to bring your instrument.</p>

		<h2>Where to learn Swing Dancing</h2>
		<p>It is rare that we offer formal beginner lessons. Some dancers may be able to show you a few things to get you started, but the best place for beginners to try out the basic steps of Lindy Hop is Thursday nights at 8pm at <a href="https://jazzattackswings.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jazz Attack</a>, just across the street from us in the Ethical Society. Entry is $10 for an hour long drop-in beginner lesson followed by a two hour social.</p>
		<p>If you’re ready to take it up a notch, we recommend taking one of <a href="https://www.ragtagempire.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RagTag Empire’s</a> 8-week progressive beginner series over at Urban Movement Arts, a few blocks west.</p>
